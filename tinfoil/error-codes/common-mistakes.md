# Common mistakes

## "When I select the Tinfoil Installer, it just kicks me out!"

This is normal behavior. If you exit the Homebrew Menu and go back to the Home Menu, you should see a game that has the Tinfoil logo on it. This is the new way to launch Tinfoil.

## "When I enter Tinfoil, I get a red screen about Hekate!"

This screen appears when Tinfoil detects a specific file called patches.ini on your SD card, which usually exists because you're using a CFW pack, which you shouldn't be. Use regular atmosphere with sigpatches and use fusee primary to boot, then you're safe to press Uninstall.
