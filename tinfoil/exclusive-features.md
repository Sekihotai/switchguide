# Exclusive Features

Tinfoil has exclusive features for ReiNX and SX OS, mostly due to them supporting piracy while Atmosphere actively tries to prevent it.

The only exclusive feature for ReiNX is the Icon View feature, which shows the games logos instead of their names, which is also included in SX OS.
