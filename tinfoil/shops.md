# Shops

Tinfoil has the ability to add "shops", which are domains that you can add to allow the installation of games from the internet. Currently, the two big shops are **/hbg/** and **Jack in the Shop**.

## [/hbg/](https://hbgshop.ga/main.html)

Benefits âœ¨

* Has almost every game
* Sometimes gets new games, updates, and DLC faster than other shops
* You can donate to get access to a donator drive for USB installing
* Dumps almost every game in any other shop

Detriments ðŸ“›

* Doesn't allow you to use your own theme, has to be one approved by /hbg/ (not going to happen)
* Doesn't have first parties, you have to pay for access to the shared drive that has them
* Discord server gets deleted a lot by Discord Administrators, which makes it harder to get the latest news about /hbg/
* Website uptime has been shotty lately, but has improved a bit
* Donator spreadsheet is broken

## [Jack in the Shop](https://jits.cc)

Benefits âœ¨

* Allows you to use your own theme
* Has first parties
* Uptime is better
* Has faster speeds than /hbg/ for some people
* Discord server doesn't violate any Discord TOS, so almost never gets taken down

Detriments ðŸ“›

* Doesn't have a donator drive that you can pay for
* Sometimes takes a while to sync the drives for the Tinfoil shop, depending on whether or not the maintainers are available
* Will occasionally break due to changes inside Tinfoil or problems within Google Drive

## [Party Shop](https://partyshop.xyz)

Benefits âœ¨

* Has first party games
* Allows you to use any theme

Detriments ðŸ“›

* ONLY has first party games, no other games

##
## Shops use Google Drive, not p2p, so you won't get any copyright complaints from your ISP
