## What are sigpatches?

Sigpatches are files that allow you to play pirated games on your Nintendo Switch. ReiNX and SX OS both have sigpatches built in, while Atmosphere does not.

## What are tickets?

Tickets are used on the Nintendo Switch to find whether or not the person owning the console actually owns the game they're trying to play. If the console doesn't find the necessary ticket, the game doesn't start. Tickets can only be found on games that are downloaded from the CDN, and installing games that are directly from the CDN without paying will result in a ban without the proper protection.
