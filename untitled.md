# FAQ

## What are sigpatches?

Sigpatches are files that allow you to play pirated games on your Nintendo Switch. ReiNX and SX OS both have sigpatches built in, while Atmosphere does not.

## What are tickets?

Tickets are used on the Nintendo Switch to find whether or not the person owning the console actually owns the game they're trying to play. If the console doesn't find the necessary ticket, the game doesn't start. Tickets can only be found on games that are downloaded from the CDN, and installing games that are directly from the CDN without paying will result in a ban without the proper protection.

## Should I use Incognito, 90DNS, or Atmosphere blanking?

Incognito is by far the safest of the three, but the least convenient. To reverse the effects of Incognito, you need to restore a prodinfo backup, and if you don't have one, then you're essentially banned. 90DNS needs to manually add new domains, so if they're too late, you could be banned. Atmosphere blanking is safer, but if you accidentally delete the exosphere.ini file, your blanking goes away. In short, Incognito is the safest option.
