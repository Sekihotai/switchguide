# Fusee Gelee

Fusee Gelee is an exploit that allows the execution of arbitrary code while in recovery mode \(RCM\). Originally discovered by the ReSwitched team. To use this exploit, you need something that can bridge the pins in the right joycon rail, and a device \(such as a phone or laptop\) that can send payloads to the Switch through a cable. 

## THIS PAGE ONLY COVERS USING A JIG AS IT IS THE ONLY TRULY SAFE METHOD. IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE, GET ONE.

## Entering RCM

**Make sure your Switch is fully powered off before following these steps.** First, insert the jig into the right joycon rail and slide it down all the way to the bottom of the rail. Then, hold the Volume Up button while pressing the power button. If you did it right, the screen should stay black, but verify that your Switch is actually in RCM mode by plugging your Switch into your preferred device and checking the injector you're using to push the payload.

**Even if your Switch can enter RCM, that does not mean that it is susceptible to the Fusee Gelee exploit. It is only susceptible if you can push a payload.**
