# Determining whether or not your Switch can be modded

Currently, all versions of the Nintendo Switch can be modified in order to run Custom Firmware. However, depending on the age of your Nintendo Switch, you may have to use different methods.

## Switch Generations

The first iteration of the Switch is called Erista, and they were produced from the launch of the Switch up to June of 2018. The exploit used to boot into custom firmware is called the [**fusee gelee**](../switch-exploits/fusee-gelee.md) exploit. 

The second iteration of the Switch is called Mariko, and it introduced various changes to the Switch, including a longer lasting battery. This revision patched the fusee gelee exploit, but is exploitable using the [SX Core modchip by Team Xecutor.]()

The third iteration of the Switch is the Switch Lite, which is a cheaper device that doesn't have detachable Joycons or the ability to use the Dock. This version also requires the SX Core modchip to run custom firmware.

## How to tell what iteration your Switch is

The best way to tell what iteration your Switch belongs to is the serial number. Sites like [ismyswitchpatched](https://ismyswitchpatched.com/) can tell you whether or not your Switch is an Erista or a Mariko. 

On [ismyswitchpatched](https://ismyswitchpatched.com/), there are three possible outcomes when inserting your serial number. It will either be not patched, patched, or possibly patched. If it is not patched, then the switch is an Erista and you have to use the fusee gelee exploit to run custom firmware. If it is possibly patched, then the switch was made while there was an overlap in Switch production between Eristas and Marikos, so there is no way to know whether or not it is a Mariko or Erista from the serial number. If the serial shows it is patched, you will need to use the SX Core, wich requires some knowledge of soldering.
